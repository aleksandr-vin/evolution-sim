# Simulating evolution

Inspired by this video from [@davidrandallmiller](https://www.youtube.com/@davidrandallmiller):

[![I programmed some creatures. They Evolved.](https://img.youtube.com/vi/N3tRFayqVtk/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/N3tRFayqVtk)

I've decided to write that program in Rust, and maybe use OpenCL at the end.

## Roadmap

## Progress

1. Generating randomly populated field X x Y

2. Saving the field into PNG
